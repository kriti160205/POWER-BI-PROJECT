# POWER-BI-PROJECT
This is my first project of POWER BI.
I created an interactive HR Summary Dashboard using Power BI to analyze employee data. The report includes key insights like total employees, salary distribution, gender breakdown, employee satisfaction, and attrition rates. I used DAX and Power Query to calculate custom measures and build dynamic visuals. The dashboard helps highlight trends by department, position, and hiring date.

Project Objectives :-

Provide a high-level summary of HR data.

Identify trends in hiring, satisfaction, and employee status.

Compare salaries by gender, department, and position.

Improve workforce planning through visual insights.

ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Features:-
Total Employees Count

Overall Salary Overview ($21M)

Gender Distribution (Male vs. Female)

Employment Status (Active, Voluntary, Terminated for Cause)

Department-wise Employee Count (e.g. Production, IT/IS, Sales)

Employee Satisfaction Breakdown

Salary by Position & Gender

Trends by Hiring Date

Slicers for filtering by Position, Department, etc.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used:-

Power BI Desktop â€“ for building and publishing the dashboard

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ for calculated measures like:

Total Salary

Average Satisfaction

Gender-wise Salary Distribution

Power Query â€“ for data cleaning, shaping, and transformation:

Filtered and removed unnecessary columns

Standardized data types

Combined tables for better visualization

ðŸ’¡Insights Delivered :-

The majority of employees belong to the Production department

Gender diversity is slightly skewed towards male employees (56%)

High employee satisfaction in engineering and IT/IS

Salary peaks during certain hiring periods (seen in Hiring Date analysis)

Clear visualization of termination patterns and attrition reasons
